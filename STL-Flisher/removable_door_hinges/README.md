I used ThinkerCad to modify ElPoPo Design

Original: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/ElPoPo/RemovableDoors

## Modifications:
Latch: 
* added 1mm offset to reduce interference with the panel. 
* Modified height to match my requirements

Hinges:
Created a model with an offset toward the exterior of the printer to allow more margin in the placement of the panel.
I also added marking to differenciate them:
  * 0.5 - round
  * 1mm - square
