# My Voron Project

The goal of this page is to keep track of what is in my printer, primary for myself but also as a reference for others.

## Current Printer:
**Main Build:** Voron v2.4
**Serial:** 2639
**Key Dates: Build:** December 27th, Serial on Jan 1st

## Characteristics
* 2.4 OriginalBuild, self-sourced
* Printed part for electronic enclosure took from the Trident version
* Z drive 80t pulley is 3d printed, will definetly get metallic one, they were a pain to tune properly.
* Stealthburner and CW2

## Mods from Others:

* [Z-Endstop Relocation](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Minsekt/Rear_Umbilical/Y_Endstop_Relocation)

## Personal mods:
### Modified Z Belt Cover -> [Here](/STL/z_belt_cover/)
* Allow passing a USB or other thick wire
* Trimmed the spot that goes under the Z Rail for easier removal.
*Modded with ThinkCAD, base on the Voron 2.4 original model, no step file available.*

### RepRack Mount for 2020 Extrusion -> [Here](/STL/2020_reprack_mount/)
* Designed for 3mm top pannel, easily moddable for more dimension.
