The goal of this page is to keep track of what is in my printer, primary for myself but also as a reference for others.

## Current Printer:
**Main Build:** Voron v2.4

**Key Dates: Build:** December 27th, Serial on Jan 1st

## Characteristics
* 2.4 Build, self-sourced
* Printed part for electronic enclosure took from the Trident version
* Z drive 80t pulley is 3d printed, will definetly get metallic one, they were a pain to tune properly.

* Sexbolt Z End Stop
* Stealthburner on CW1, 
* Cover : need to find the link again, it's the modded version where the shaft doesn't freefallwith custom PCB
